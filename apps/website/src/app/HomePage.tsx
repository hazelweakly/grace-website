              <p className='text-lg ftext-black font-normal'>
                I am a career professional with 12 years of experience across
                multiple industries. After my experience working in software
                sales, I changed careers to Software Engineering because I
                wanted to build the software products I was recommending to
                others: tools and solutions that empower people to progress on
                their goals in everyday life and the workplace.
                <br />
                <br />I gained valuable skills and experience in the previous
                roles I’ve held. As an Accountant, I facilitated discussions
                with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to exchange
                information critical to business operations. As a Software
                Advisor working in lead generation, I sought to understand the
                problems of small, mid-market, and enterprise buyers to
                recommend software solutions tailored to their needs. That
                process required me to communicate succinctly and adapt to the
                stakeholder. I also gained experience communicating with
                non-technical buyers who expressed the need for additional
                support to understand what tech solutions would suit their
                needs. As a high-performing professional, I have excelled in my
                previous roles because I love continuous growth and helping
                others thrive.
