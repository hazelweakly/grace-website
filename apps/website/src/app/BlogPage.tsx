                  Throughout my last few projects, I used useState to manage the
                  different states I was tracking in my app. My apps continually
                  had way too many props passed to and through the components.
                  Because of this, I called my last several projects “prop
                  happy.” Entering my final project for Bootcamp, I am taking a
                  different approach. Enter Recoil. Recoil is a state management
                  library for React.
